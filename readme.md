## This is a work in progress to build a CSP Header analyzing tool.

  * Build list of visited websites to extend potential crawling capability of internal sublinks
  * Include analysis of action tags
  * Refine logic of determining if a link is email, internal, external, source, or suspicious
  * Expend list to include additional categories as needed
  * Ensure each list does not contain duplicate links
  * Build ability to search for a website based on input
  * Refactoring to clean up repetitive code
